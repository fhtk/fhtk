## No peer review or verification of factuality

Our active community of contributors do their best to ensure the correctness of any information provided as part of our code. However, we are not uniformly peer reviewed; while contributors may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even text that has been vetted by informal peer review processes may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.

None of the contributors, sponsors, administrators or anyone else connected with the Fanhacker’s Toolkit in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.

Their use here does not imply that you may use them for any purpose other than for the same or a similar informational use as contemplated by the original authors of our content under the relevant licensing schemes. Unless otherwise stated, the Fanhacker’s Toolkit is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with any of the holders of any such rights and as such it cannot grant any rights to use any otherwise protected materials.
